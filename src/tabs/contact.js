    <li>Phone NASA. Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explain that it's very important that you get away as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>If they do not cooperate, phone a friend you might have in the White House- (202) 456-1414- to have a word on your behalf with the guys at NASA.</li>
    <li>If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin (Ask the overseas operator for 0107-095- 295-9051). They don't have any friends there either (at least, none to speak of), but they do seem to have a little influence, so you might as well try.</li>
    <li>If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number is 001-39-6-6982, and I gather that his switchboard is infallible.</li>
    <li>If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explain that it's vitally important you get away before your phone bill arrives.</li>
